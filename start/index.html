                <p class="left-align">Girl with a Pearl Earring is one of Johannes Verrneer's masterworks and , as the
                    name implies, uses a pearl earring for the focal point. Today the painting is kept in the
                    Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague. It is sometimes referred to as "the Mona Lisa of the North" or
                    "the Duth Mona Lisa".</p>
